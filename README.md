Week 1 of DATA 607 considered proxies. Md Forhad Akbar evaluated per capita Gross Domestic Procuct as a proxy for standard of living, citing well-considered advantages and disadvantages. Akbar compared GDP and the Human Development Index, which appears in the United Nations Development Program's Human
Development Report.

Standard of living is an abstraction for which there is no objective measure. Therefore, HDI is
itself yet another proxy, and a comparison of GDP to HDI may not indicate the effectiveness of
GDP as a proxy for standard of living.

Still, a comparison of the two reveals their correlation, and since the two measures differ, it is
meaningful to consider which may be a better indication of standard of living. That is the topic of Akbar's post.
